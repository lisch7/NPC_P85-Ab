# What is the study?
Anti-Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV) BNLF2b (P85-Ab) has shown promise in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) screening. However, its diagnostic performance in outpatient settings remains unclear. In this prospective, multicenter, head-to-head comparison cohort study, we compared the diagnostic performance of P85-Ab with that of VCA-IgA, EA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA, and plasma EBV-DNA in outpatient clinics.

# Key findings of the study
- P85-Ab demonstrated the best diagnostic performance among the EBV-related biomarkers assessed for NPC detection.
- P85-Ab exhibited the highest sensitivity in detecting early-stage NPC.
- P85-Ab maintained robust specificity across different disease categories, particularly in the differential diagnosis of other EBV-related diseases.
- We evaluated optimal combination strategies and proposed a clinical application strategy using P85-Ab, VCA-IgA, EA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA, and plasma EBV-DNA.
